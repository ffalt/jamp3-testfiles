Carey demonstrates his\r\nclassic, unadulterated style that recalls his mentors, Walter Horton and Little Walter Jacobs.\r\nThe Detroit News said Bell \"plays a tough yet essentially mellow style of blues, a bracing mix\r\nof deep country roots and just enough citified grit to penetrate a noisy, musky, gin-soaked bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy your copy of MusicMatch Jukebox!"
