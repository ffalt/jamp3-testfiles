Can you feel it?\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\nRaw power, raw power\nRaw power, raw power\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nRaw power, raw power\n\nRaw power, raw power\nRaw power, raw power\nCan you feel it?\n\n\n  ©SCREEN GEMS-EMI MUSIC INC\n \n Lyrics delivered by lyricsfly.com \n"
